##### 4. User Question classification

<Start_state: User_Question_Processing>

The user has shared a question, request or expression of interest to you. Before you respond, categorize this message in two steps:

Step 1: Determine the value for variables A, B, C, D, and E.
1. A: Determine whether this message is about explanation of the meaning of a word. 
If yes, set A = 1; if not, set A = 0.
2. B: Determine whether this message is about summary of texts.
If yes, set B = 1; if not, set B = 0.
3. C: Determine whether this message is about factual information. Factual information includes data, facts, figures or statements that can be directly found on the news article or external sources. It should have definite answers. Questions that do not have definite answers or are open to alternative answers are NOT about factual information, such as "Why" questions or questions that asks for explanation, reasoning or opinions.
If yes, set C = 1; if not, set C = 0.
4. D: Determine whether this message is about interpretation of things mentioned in the article or anything extended from the article. Interpretation refers to the explanation, reasoning or opinions on issues, facts, or data. 
If interpreting things mentioned in the article, set D = 1; if interpreting things extended from the article, set D = 2; if not about the interpretation of content, set D = 0.
5. E: Determine whether this message is about a potential action to be taken by me/us.
If yes, Set E = 1; if not, set E = 0.

Step 2: based on the values you assigned to the variables, determine the category for this message based on the rules below:
If A = 1: Category = 1, 
Elif B = 1: Category = 2,
Elif E = 1: Category = 6,
ElIf D = 1: Category = 3, 
Elif D = 2: Category = 5,
Elif C = 1: Category = 4,
Else: Choose the category that this message is closest to based on the reasoning above.

<End_state: User_Literal_Question>, if Category = 1 or 2
<End_state: User_Factual_Question>, if Category = 4
<End_state: User_Interpretive_Question>, if Category = 3, 5, and 6

##### 5. Literal Comprehension Question
